## 🔥 MaskPhish
MaskPhish is not any Phishing tool. It's just a proof of concept of "URL Making Technology". It is a simple Bash Script to hide phishing URL under a normal looking URL (google.com or facebook.com). It can be integrated into Phishing tools (with proper credits) to look the URL ledgit.
